GDLite Compiler (gdlc)
======================

Compile a GDScript-like language → into Python.
Import modules from GitHub, run on Linux & Termux, and write lightweight scripts that compile to Python.


---

### Why GDLite?

GDLite was created to:

- Write code with simpler syntax similar to GDScript

- Still use the Python ecosystem

- Import modules directly from GitHub

- Run easily on Termux / Linux


- Write lightweight code → get Python output.


---

### Quick Demo

File hello.gdl:

```
func main():
    print("Hello from GDL!")

main()
```

Compile:

```
gdlc hello.gdl
```

Run:

```
python hello.py
```

Output:

```
Hello from GDL!
```


---

### Features

- Lightweight syntax inspired by GDScript

- Compiles to Python

- Import modules directly from GitHub

- CLI tool (gdlc)

- Termux support



---

### Installation

Linux / Mac

```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lintang143/GDLC-GDLite-Compiler-/main/install.sh | bash
```

Termux

```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lintang143/GDLC-GDLite-Compiler-/main/termux/install.sh | bash
```

### Requirements

- python3

- git



---

### Running .gdl Files

- First compile:

```
gdlc yourfile.gdl
```

- Then run the generated Python file:

```
python yourfile.py
```


---

### GDLite Basics

- Print

```
print("string")
print(variable)
print(f"string {variable}")
```

- Variables

```
var i = "hello"
var i = 1
var i = True
var i = False
```

- Functions

```
func hello():
    print("Hello World!")

hello()
```

> The rest of the logic works like Python.




---

### Import Modules from GitHub

```
github repo from user import file
```

Example:

```
github gdl-modules from Lintang143 import mathplus

print(mathplus.plus(12,5))
```

You can also import it without run your gdl files:

```
gdlc install gdl-modules Lintang143 mathplus
```

---

### Import Python Modules

```
import module
```

Example:
```
import requests
```

---

### Roadmap

- Simple package manager

- Better error messages

- Windows support

- Full syntax documentation
